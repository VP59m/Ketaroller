@page introduction_page Introduction to the KetaRoller project

<p>
This document will give an overview over the concepts, the design choices and the implementation details
behind KetaRoller, an advanced signal router for musical devices.

@section who_intro_sec Who this document is aimed to

<p>
This document is aimed to people interested in KetaRoller's design and internals, developers intending to create user interfaces
to KetaRoller, or developers interested in developing plugins for KetaRoller, including sound synthesis systems, protocol
implementations, etc.
</p>

@section main_intro_sec What is KetaRoller and where we are at

<p>
KetaRoller can be seen as a router for musical signals. It takes care of carrying a signal from one end to another - it
has nothing to do with signal processing. Its main aim is to allow connections between arbitrary devices which use the
same protocols through a set of "Ports" which are able to seize input signals in more specific and understandable parts.
</p><p>
KetaRoller is a Qt library extendable through plugins. It can be used into an application to create a connection from input
control surfaces to output devices. The internal logic takes care of the routing part only, and by default implements just two
protocols (MIDI and TUIO). KetaRoller, though, is designed to be extended by 3rd parties with output devices (usually
sound generation systems, such as BCT), and with new protocols if needed.
</p>

@note This package just provides the base library and TUIO and MIDI protocol implementations - no real output devices are supplied.
      Although, some fake output devices are provided in the tests/ directory for testing purposes - those devices just print text
      to a terminal and serve as a proof of concept for implementing real-world devices.

<p>
Despite KetaRoller being completely multiplatform, this release will support Linux only. Building on Mac and Windows is possible,
but no warranties or support are given on those two platforms, so <b>do this at your own risk!</b>.
At least Mac will be fully supported in the near future.
</p>

@section protocol_overview_sec Protocols used by KetaRoller
<p>
KetaRoller aims towards full abstraction, as it will be explained later - in this project, two protocols were implemented:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)</b>. An industry standard protocol for musical instrument
           communication. See @ref midi_protocol_sec "MIDI explained" for a better overview.</li>
    <li><b>TUIO</b>. A protocol for table-top tangible user interfaces based on OpenSoundControl. See
        @ref tuio_protocol_sec "TUIO explained" for a better overview.</li>
</ul>

@section bachelor_thesis_overview_sec KetaRoller in our Bachelor's thesis project
<p>
This project is a part of the big picture in our bachelor's thesis project, where we will implement a full-fledged
ReacTable (developed by MTG of Universit√† Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona) which will communicate with the sound synthesis
system BCT (developed by ISPG of Politecnico di Milano) throughout this very project. The final aim is to play/control
a musical instrument, created with this particular synthesis method, through a simple MIDI controller and ReacTable.
</p>
<p>
Given that ReacTable communicates through TUIO, as a first step we need to implement a software capable of handling
both protocols: this software should be able to receive packets, extract information through the use of the protocol
standard, and be able to provide concrete data to an output device (which will be the BCT - in this project, we will
use some fake output devices for printing messages for testing purposes).
</p>

@section tests_keta_sec Test cases and examples
<p>
We provided a set of autotests and manual test/examples in the tests/ folder. You can run the three autotests for checking
KetaRoller and its plugins' correct operation and check against regressions, and the two tests in manual/ for trying KetaRoller with
reacTIVision... and have some fun with fiducials!
